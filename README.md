# gh-actions-deploy-example

This is a very simple password generator app, written in HTML and vanilla JS (using parcel-bundler).

The App gets tested, built and then uploaded to the production server using GitHub Actions (workflows)

Note: Passwords are generated using a pseudo-random algorithm only. App is only for demo.
